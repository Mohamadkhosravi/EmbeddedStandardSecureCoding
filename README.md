## Overview

Embedded systems development often requires adherence to specific coding standards and guidelines to ensure safety, reliability, and maintainability. This repository consolidates key documents that outline these standards, particularly focusing on C and C++ languages, which are commonly used in embedded systems.

## Included Documents

The following PDF documents are included in this repository:

1. **BARR-C 2018.pdf**:  
   A comprehensive guide to the BARR-C:2018 coding standard, which provides rules and recommendations for coding in C in a way that enhances code safety, portability, and maintainability, particularly for embedded systems.

2. **Google C++ Style Guide.pdf**:  
   A style guide from Google, detailing best practices for writing clear, consistent, and reliable C++ code. It covers topics like code formatting, naming conventions, and use of specific language features.

3. **MISRA-C-2004.pdf**:  
   The MISRA-C:2004 guidelines for the C programming language, developed by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA). These guidelines help in writing safe and reliable code for automotive and other critical systems.

4. **MISRA-CPP-2008.pdf**:  
   The MISRA C++:2008 guidelines for the C++ programming language, aimed at helping developers avoid common pitfalls and write safe, portable code in embedded systems.

5. **MISRA-C 2012.pdf**:  
   The updated MISRA-C:2012 guidelines, which build upon the 2004 edition, providing more comprehensive rules and guidance for writing secure and reliable C code in critical systems.
